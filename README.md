# DiscordLyricBot
 A command will announce a word that users should try to rhyme with. The bot will listen and tell you if you are correct or not (your word rhymes with the word announced or not). It will continue to listen until all words have been said that rhyme with announced word.

 How it works: "^rhyme" command will pull a random word from an API. This word will then be used to access a rhyming API, a database of words that rhyme with said word. These two API's together can accomplish the task with lots of string manipulation and array traversing in order to compare words listened to.
